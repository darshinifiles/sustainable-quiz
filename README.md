The purpose of the game is to educate our community in Hawaii of our state’s sustainability goals. Community awareness is an important step in reaching any goal on any level. To create this game, our team used the Sublime Text editor to code with html, css, and javascript. Our creation is a webpage that is formatted to fit the size of a phone. This makes the website accessible anywhere and on any device. When playing Pics-A-Goal, the goal of the game is to guess a word based on the pictures given. The word relates to one of the government’s sustainability goals and the general topic of being environmentally friendly. At the end of the game, information about the words which relates the game back to Hawaii's goals are given.
