		<h1>Sustainability Goals</h1>

		<h2>Solar Panels</h2>
			<p>Solar panels are a common method of renewable energy, especially in Hawaii. Implementing solar panels can help our state reach our goal of 100% renewable energy by 2045.</p>

		<h2>Farmer's Market</h2>
			<p>Farmer’s markets promote sustainability by encouraging the production of local food. This also encourages local businesses.</p>

		<h2>Wind Power</h2>
			<p>Wind power is a type of renewable energy. Wind turbines are used to turn kinetic energy from the wind into electricity.</p>

		<h2>Fossil Fuel</h2>
			<p>Fossil fuels include things like coal and natural gas, but they are not reliable. At the rate we are using them, we are projected to deplete our sources of fossil fuels before the end of the century.</p>

		<h2>Watershed</h2>
			<p>Watersheds affect the quality of water that we consume and use for recreational activities. To ensure uncontaminated drinking water, we must protect and maintain our watersheds.</p>

		<h2>Geothermal</h2>
			<p>Geothermal energy is a type of renewable energy generated from the earth’s heat. On the Big Island, we can take advantage of volcanically-heated water and steam to help us reach our sustainability goals.</p>
